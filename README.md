## "I am the God of Thunder and Protector of Earthrealm!"

Greetings, mortal. You have discovered **Project Raden** - a repository blessed by the Thunder God himself! (Yes, it's spelled "Raden" - a playful twist on the legendary Raiden!) 

Just as Raiden protects Earthrealm from the forces of Outworld, this project harnesses the power of climate data to protect our realm from the forces of nature. With lightning-fast analytics and thunder-striking insights, we monitor urban heat patterns, heatwaves, and climate anomalies.

## ⚡ "Your journey begins..." ⚡

But wait! The true power lies not here in this outer realm. To unlock the secrets of climate analytics and wield the full force of this thunder-blessed platform, you must journey forth into the sacred directory:

### 🌩️ **Navigate into `raydenrules/`** 🌩️

```bash
cd raydenrules/
```

There, you will find:
- 🔥 The complete documentation and quickstart guide
- ⚡ FastAPI backend wielding REST endpoints like lightning bolts  
- 🌪️ Reflex web dashboard with interactive visualizations
- 🌊 Kedro data pipelines flowing like thunder through the clouds

## "There are fates worse than death..."

...like not reading the README! Once you've entered the `raydenrules/` directory, consult the README within to begin your training.

## "I must consult with the Elder Gods..."

```bash
cd raydenrules/
cat README.md  # Reveal the ancient texts
```

*"For the Elder Gods, for Earthrealm, for climate analytics!"* ⚡🌩️⚡

**- Raiden, God of Thunder**
